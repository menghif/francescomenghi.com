Hello there! Iâ€™m Francesco and this is my personal website.

I am a software developer based in Toronto Canada. I am originally from Italy and also lived in France for a number of years. I am interested in Web Development and working in Open Source.

Before switching paths and becoming a software developer, I previously worked in the finance sector after obtaining a university degree in economics. In 2020, I went back to school to learn how to code and it was one of the best decisions I have made!

## Work

I currently work as a software developer at [Teknion](https://www.teknion.com/ca), where I focus on the Teknion extension for the [Configura](https://www.configura.com) CET Commercial Interiors application.

## Web Dev and Open Source

My interest in Open Source started when I was a student working on [Telescope](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope): a blogging aggregator web app built using a React frontend and micro-services as backend. Today, I like to find and contribute to Open Source projects and stay up to date with the constantly evolving web development space.

## Skills

Among others, these are the skills I am currently focused on:

- Javascript
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Astro
- Node.js
