Hello there! Iâ€™m Francesco and this is my personal website.

I am a software developer based in Toronto Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and I am originally from Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹. I am interested in Web Development and working in Open Source.

## Work

I am currently employed as a software developer at [Teknion](https://www.teknion.com/ca), where I focus on the Teknion extension for the [Configura](https://www.configura.com) CET Commercial Interiors application. I studied Computer Programming and Analysis at [Seneca](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/home.html).

## Open Source

I like to find Open Source projects to contribute to. In my last year at Seneca, I worked on an Open Source project called [Telescope](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope): a blogging aggregator web app, built using a React frontend and micro-services as backend. It was a great opportunity to collaborate in a group setting on a big codebase and get familiar with working in Open Source.

## Skills

These are the skills I am currently focused on:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
